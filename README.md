# PFlender README
PFlender is a small fun c# coding project of me.
It will (hopefully) be a small 2D animation software in which you can create simple 2D animations for games or just for fun.
The following features are on my current "I want to have this in here" list:
* adding multiple different objects
* make an parent-child constellation for 2 actors
* add a working color wheel
* add a small drawing module (so you can create a 2D Animation by drawing every frame)
* make multiple export formats
* different keyframe types (Bezier curves, linear)
* (maybe) add simple physics
* (maybe) add simple 3D version
* (hopefully) simple interface

PFlender is in it's current state relative primitive. It's current Version has only some small features like adding Actors and it's currently not having an real interface (If you want to add Actors/keyframes you'll have to do it by code in Main.cs. It'll grow though. If I atleast stick with it...



***Setup***

To get PFlender's *source code* running on your system you'll need to have C# (cs , csharp) installed. You can find a good IDE (Visual Studio) for c# here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com              
Because the project is currently made with the .NET Framework 4.8 on Windows Forms, you'll need to make sure both is installed somewhere on your system.


Feel free to make your own version of PFlender or help me out with it whenever you want.
